# Thinking Claude

Let Claude think comprehensively before responding!

> **a super quick reminder:**
> thinking claude **is not aimed for benchmarks or huge leaps in math or something**, since they are pre-determined by the base model (new Claude-3.5 Sonnet).
> i only want to explore how further we could reach with Claude's "deep mindset". that's said, when using it in your daily tasks, you would found Claude's inner monolog (thinking process) very very fun and interesting.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:
1. **Thinking Protocol**: A comprehensive set of instructions that guides Claude to think deeply and systematically before responding
2. **Browser Extension**: A tool that makes Claude's thinking process more readable and manageable in the browser interface

## Thinking Protocol

The thinking protocol instructs Claude to follow a natural, thorough thought process before providing responses.
